# ðŸ“Š Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Churn Analysis** using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**. The main objective was to predict which customers are likely to discontinue using a service based on historical data.

## Key Highlights
- Performed **data cleaning** and **missing value handling** to prepare the dataset.
- Conducted detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.
- Created **feature engineering** strategies to boost model performance.
- Built and evaluated machine learning models, including **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees**.
- Assessed model performance using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Goal
To develop a predictive model that helps businesses **understand customer behavior** and **reduce churn** by taking proactive, data-driven actions.
